# my-readme-generator

// Our assignment was to create a dynamic command-line README generator using the recently learned Node.js and the .inquirer module. This assignment at first seemed daunting but almost immediately helped solidify some questionable or confusing Javascript syntax, further providing a better understanding on the language as a whole.

I accomplished:

Creating the easily generated README file, taking the majority of my users input in relation to what was asked in the acceptance criteria, and writing it into a readable file to then be converted into a README.md format. There were still some bugs and issues I ran into before deploying, however. I couldn't figure out how to display the different badges that were chosen, but I think I was on the right track with the programming. 

Node, so far, has been very interesting to dive into and I look forward to more experience with it.
